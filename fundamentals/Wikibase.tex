\section{Wikibase}
Wikibase is an open source project, which was developed for and is mainly used by Wikidata. It is a MediaWiki extension. \\
Wikibase consists of two parts: \textit{Wikibase repository} and \textit{Wikibase client}. \textbf{Wikibase repository} (in the following text only ``repository'')  stores and manages structured, non-relational, and editable data. \citep{wikibase:01} \\
\textbf{Wikibase client} (in the following text only ``client'') enables the retrieving of a repository's data on a wiki. \citep{wikibase:01} The interlanguage links for example are pulled from the repository via a shared changes database table and a maintaince script. Then they are sorted by the client's settings. \citep{wiki:18} \\
In the case of Wikidata and Wikipedia, Wikidata is a repository and any Wikipedia connected to Wikidata is a client.
