\section{Wikibase}
Wikibase is an open source project, which was developed for and is mainly used by Wikidata. It is a MediaWiki extension. \\
\\
Wikibase consists of two parts: a \textit{Wikibase repository} and a \textit{Wikibase client}. \\
The \textbf{Wikibase repository} (in the following text only ``repository'')  stores and manages structured, non-relational and editable data \citep{wikibase:01}. \\
The \textbf{Wikibase client} (in the following text only ``client'') enables the retrieval of a repository's data on a wiki \citep{wikibase:01}. The interlanguage links for example are pulled from the repository via a shared changes database table and a maintenance script \citep{wiki:18}. \\
\\
In the case of Wikidata and Wikipedia, Wikidata is a repository and any Wikipedia connected to Wikidata is a client.
