\section{Languages online}

As visible in Figure~\ref{fig:w3techLang} and Figure~\ref{fig:listLang}, the by far most common language online is English. 53.8\% of the content online is in this language, followed by Russian, German and Japanese. \citep{w3techLang} \\
\\
A similar picture can be seen when looking at Wikipedia. English, Swedish, German, Dutch, French and Russian are among the top ten biggest Wikipedias in terms of the numbers of articles as visible in Figure~\ref{fig:wikipedias-articles}. \\

%\caption{Number of articles and number of Wikipedias}
The English Wikipedia is the only one with over five million articles. There are eleven Wikipedias with between one and four million articles. Even though there are only 48 Wikipedias with between zero and a thousand articles, there are 227 Wikipedias with between one thousand and one million articles, visualized in Figure~\ref{fig:tableNumWP}. \citep{wiki:30} \\

When compared to the numbers of first-language speakers a huge gap is clearly visible: The most widespread languages are Chinese, Spanish, English, and Hindi. Hindi, for example, is only the 57th biggest Wikipedia however.
\begin{quote}
Using the benchmark of 100,000 Wikipedia pages in any given language, it found that only 53 percent of the worldâ€™s population has access to sufficient content in their native language to make use of the Internet relevant.

The conclusion can be drawn that there are a few languages that are very well resourced, while a fast majority of speakers of other languages do not have access to much information in their native language. \todo{Quote that this one of the mayor problems for access}
