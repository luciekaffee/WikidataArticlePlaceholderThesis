\section{MediaWiki}

MediaWiki is the software used to run Wikipedia. It is a ``free and open source wikipackage written in PHP'' \citep{wiki:13} using a MySQL database. Originally it was developed for Wikipedia but by now it is used by many other Wiki projects inside and outside the Wikimedia world such as Wikimedia Commons and EVA, ``the private wiki used to support operations of the International Space Station at NASA Johnson Space Center'' \citep{eva-nasa}. It is developed by the Wikimedia Foundation and MediaWiki volunteers. It was initially released on January 25, 2002. \citep{wiki:13} Due to the extensive use on Wikipedia, MediaWiki is optimized to handle huge amounts of data and high traffic. \citep{wiki:14} \\
\\
To adjust the software to the user's needs, it has 878 configuration settings. \citep{wiki:15} \\
MediaWiki provides the base for many other projects such as Wikibase. To enable or change various features 2,386 extensions are currently available. \citep{wiki:16} One of these extensions is Wikibase. \\

Pages in MediaWiki are grouped in \textit{namespaces}. Namespaces are used to sort pages according to their purpose. They are indicated in the page title with a prefix such as \texttt{\justify Namespace:PageTitle}. Pages without a prefix are in the \textit{mainspace}. Namespaces can be localized. \citep{wiki:17}
