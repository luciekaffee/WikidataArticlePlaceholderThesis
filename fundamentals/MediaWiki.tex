\section{MediaWiki}

MediaWiki is the software used to run Wikipedia. It is a ``free and open source wikipackage written in PHP'' \citep{wiki:13} usually using a MySQL database. Originally it was developed for Wikipedia but it is currently used by many other Wiki projects inside and outside the Wikimedia world such as Wikimedia Commons and EVA, ``the private wiki used to support operations of the International Space Station at NASA Johnson Space Center'' \citep{eva-nasa}. It is developed by the Wikimedia Foundation and MediaWiki volunteers. It was initially released on January 25, 2002. \citep{wiki:13} Due to the extensive use on Wikipedia, MediaWiki is optimized to handle huge amounts of data and high traffic. \citep{wiki:14} \\
\\
To adjust the software to the user's needs, it has 878 configuration settings. \citep{wiki:15} \\
MediaWiki also provides the base for many other projects such as Wikibase. \todo{clarify} To enable or change various features, 2.386 extensions are currently available. \citep{wiki:16} One of these extensions is Wikibase. \\

Pages in MediaWiki are grouped into \textit{namespaces}. Namespaces are used to sort pages according to their purpose. They are indicated in the page title with a prefix such as \texttt{\justify Namespace:PageTitle}. Pages without a prefix are in the \textit{mainspace}. Namespaces can be localized. \citep{wiki:17}
