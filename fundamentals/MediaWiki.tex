\subsection{MediaWiki}

MediaWiki is the free and open software which is used to run Wikipedia. It is a ``free and open source wikipackage written in PHP''\footnote{\href{https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki}{Reference}} using a MySQL database. Originally it was developed for Wikipedia but by now it is used by many other Wiki projects inside and outside the Wikimedia world like Wikimedia Commons and WikiLeaks. It is developed by the Wikimedia Foundation and MediaWiki volunteers. It was initially released on January 25, 2002\footnote{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki}{Reference}}. Due to the extensive use of Wikipedia, MediaWiki is optimized to handle huge amounts of data and high traffic\footnote{\href{https://www.mediawiki.org/w/index.php?title=Manual:What_is_MediaWiki\%3F&oldid=743778}{Reference}}. \\
To adjust the software to the users needs, it has 878 configuration settings\footnote{\href{https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Configuration_settings_\%28alphabetical\%29}{Configuration Settings (alphabetically)}}. \\
MediaWiki just provides the bases for many other projects like Wikibase. To enable or change various features 2,386 extensions are currently available\footnote{\href{https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Category:All_extensions}{All extensuins (alphabetically)}}. One of these extensions is Wikibase.
