\section{Template on Wikipedia}

A template on Wikipedia is a page in the \texttt{\justify Template} namespace, which is created to be included in other Wikipedia pages. ``Templates usually contain repetitive material that might need to show up on any number of articles or pages.'' \citep{wiki:21} Examples for the usage of those are infoboxes, explained in \ref{infobox}: \nameref{infobox}. \\\
Templates can be included on any Wikipedia content page with the following syntax:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single] 
{{template name|parameter}}
\end{lstlisting}
