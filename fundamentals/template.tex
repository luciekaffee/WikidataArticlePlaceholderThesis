\subsection{Template on Wikipedia}

A Template on the Wikipedia is a page in the \textit{Template} namespace, that is created to be included in other Wikipedia pages. ``Templates usually contain repetitive material that might need to show up on any number of articles or pages.''\footnote{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Template}{Refernce}} Examples for the usage of those are Infoboxes, tables on Wikipedia which usually follow a certain format. \\\
Themplates can be called on any Wikipedia content page with the following syntax. \\
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
