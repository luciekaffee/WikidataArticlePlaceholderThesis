\subsection{Wikipedia}
Wikipedia is one of the largest websites in the world with articles in over 250 languages. While this thesis is being written, in January 2016, the English Wikipedia alone amounts to 5,000,000 articles. 
The concept of Wikipedia is fairly simple: An open encyclopaedia anyone can contribute to. It was launched on January 15, 2001.
