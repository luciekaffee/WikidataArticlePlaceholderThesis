\subsection{Wikipedia}
Wikipedia is one of the largest websites in the world with articles on different topics in over 250 languages. While writing this thesis, in November 2015, the English Wikipedia alone reached 5,000,000 articles. 
The concept of the Wikipedia is fairly simple: An open encyclopaedia, anyone can contribute to. It was launched on January 15, 2001.
