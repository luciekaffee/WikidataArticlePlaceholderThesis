\chapter{Conclusion and outlook}

The main goal of this thesis is to increase access to free and open knowledge by providing access to information in languages, that are often not considered. Due to the implementation of the ArticlePlaceholder, it is now possible to generate content pages on the Wikipedia for Wikidata data. \\
This is not only a theoretical improvement but also wished by the communities as visible in the discussion pages on the local Wikipedias. \\
\\
To evaluate how useful the extension will be for the different Wikipedias, it will be necessary to observe how many meaningful articles will be created with its help and whether they will make bot created stubs superfluous. \\
Possible further research could look into natural language processing and creating text from data. \\
\\
In the future, many of the aspects mentioned before will be certainly implemented such as the possibility of content translation, starting the article creation with data from Wikidata, adjusting the extension also for sister projects, and making the ArticlePlaceholder pages indexable. The extension offers a basis to realize this and already implements many of the features that may change the accessibility of under-resourced languages to the better. \\
\\
The development of the ArticlePlaceholder is ongoing.
