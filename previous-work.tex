\subsection{Infobox}
\todo{connect to wiki:05}
Infoboxes are tables on the top right of Wikipedia pages which display a summary of an articles topic. They are static tables created by editors. They can display data from Wikidata but up to date mostly don't. They are the first and most important way data is displayed on Wikipedia. They are of great value for the articles and allow the reader to get a quick overview. \\
It is important to consider how infoboxes work but still differ the layout of the Article Placeholder so the two are not confused with each other.

\subsection{Reasonator}
Reasonator \footnote{https://tools.wmflabs.org/reasonator/} by Magnus Manske written mostly in JavaScript. It has a very similar approach to the Article Placeholder extension- it displays items from Wikidata in a visually appealing way, aimed at readers rather than Wikidata editors. Reasonator does not stick to the typical Wikipedia layout but tries to find the best way possible to display the data. \\
The items are- when appropriate- separated in the classes  \todo{connect to wiki:06} "people, locations, [and] species". Therefore it is possible to display the data in a way that responds to the subject matter. \\

\subsection{Wdsearch.js}
Wdsearch.js \todo{the link}\footnote{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Wdsearch.js&action=raw&ctype=text/javascript}{Script on English Wikipedia}} is a script that includes search results from Wikidata on Wikipedia. It is written in JavaScript and enabled. \\
Using this script, search results from Wikidata are enclosed at the bottom of the normal Wikipedia search. The label of the item contains a link to the Wikidata item. A short description gives a user an overview, if it's the topic they were looking for. A user can choose to read the topic on either a different Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons or Resonator, using three buttons. \\
To date, the script is enabled on Polish and Italian Wikipedia. It helps users to find more information on a topic they are looking for but as of now, the user is forced to visit another website. Knowledge of how to use this other website is required. \\
The idea to include Wikidata search results is something Article Placeholder picks up and tries to improve. The Wikidata search results are supposed to be added to the Wikipedia search page, too, but the user should stay on their language Wikipedia.
