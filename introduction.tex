\section{Introduction}
One of the biggest barriers for accessing knowledge on the Internet is language. The tendency is to provide information in one or at most a few languages, which makes it hard for speakers of all other languages to access that same information. This is also an issue with Wikipedia, a project used all across the globe by all kinds of people. There are many topics that are only covered in a few languages on Wikipedia. People who do not speak these do not have access to all the information available and potentially vital to them. This is a huge issue that needs to be addressed. \\
\\
Today there is Wikidata, Wikimedia’s knowledge base, which collects multilingual structured data in one central place and makes it publicly available under CC0, a public domain dedication. \footnote{\href{https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/}{https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/}} \\
The goal of the ArticlePlaceholder extension  is to give more people more access to more knowledge by making use of Wikipedia’s reach and Wikidata’s multilingual data.
