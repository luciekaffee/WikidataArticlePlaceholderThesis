\section{Display}
	The display is one of the main parts of the ArticlePlaceholder, as it is user-facing and therefore needs an initial default design. \\

	The core part of the page is formed by the statement groups. These consist of a property, one or multiple values, and their qualifiers. \\
	Each statement group is in a box with a black border and arranged in a tile layout. The number of statement boxes per row differs depending on the width of the screen. \\
	The main image of the item is on the right side (for left to right languages) of the page, where it would also be in articles.\\
	The label of the property is the header for each group, which is separated from the body by a horizontal line. Multiple values for the same statement are also separated by a line. Their qualifiers are directly under the corresponding value. \\
	References can be found in their own section at the bottom of the page, conforming to the existing layout of Wikipedia. \\
	The identifier of an item should be in a distinct position so as to be both emphasized and distinguishable from the other statements. They are listed below the main image of the article to the right of the statement groups.
