	The main image of the item is on the right side (for left to right languages) of the page where it would be in articles as well.\\
	The core part of the page are the statement groups. Those consist of a property, one or multiple values, their qualifiers and references. \\
	The statement groups are each in a box with a black border and arranged in a tile layout. The amount of statement boxes per row differs depending on the width of the screen. \\
	The label of the property is the header for each group which is separated from the body by a horizontal line. Multiple values for the same statement are also separated by a line. Their qualifiers are right under the corresponding value and in a smaller font. \\
	References can be found in their own section at the bottom of the page sticking to the existing layout of Wikipedia. \\
	The identifier of an item should be in a distinct place in order to be emphasized and distinguishable from the other statements at the same time. They are listed below the main image of the article to the right of the statement groups.
