\subsection{Search}
In order to be able to find results from the placeholder in the MediaWiki search, it was necessary to use the SearchHook provided by MediaWiki.
With the help of the \texttt{TermIndexSearchInteractor} provided by Wikibase all items with labels or aliases matching the given search term are returned. The \texttt{TermIndexSearchInteractor} and its respective tests needed to be moved from Wikibase repository to Wikibase library in order to be accessible for both, client and repository. This was done by the author in a commit to the Wikibase code \footnote{\href{https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/\#/c/243723/}{Gerrit link}}.

From those a string containing the label of the item, displayed as a link to the special page with the corresponding entity ID, and the description of the item in case there are multiple results.  \\
If the result is not empty, the results are added to the search page as Wikitext. \\
