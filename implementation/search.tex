\subsubsection{Search}
In order to include to be able to find results from the placeholder in the MediaWiki search it was necessary to use the SerachHook provided by MediaWiki.
With the help of the TermSearchInteractor provided by Wikibase, which needed to be moved to the Wikibase lib in order to be able to use the service in client and not only in repo as before, all items with labels or aliases matching the given search term are returned. From those a string containing the label of the item, displayed as a link to the special page with the corresponding entity ID, and the description of the item in case there are multiple results.  \\
If the result is not empty, the results are added to the search page as Wikitext.
