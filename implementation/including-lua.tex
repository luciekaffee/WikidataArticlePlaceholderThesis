\section{Including PHP in Lua}\label{including-lua}

To pass the return values of PHP functions to Lua, Scribunto provided functionality is used. \\
The functions accessible by the Lua code are declared in the class \texttt{\justify Scribunto\char`_LuaArticlePlaceholderLibrary}. This class extends \texttt{\justify Scribunto\char`_LuaLibraryBase} to register the Lua interface. \\
To get the image property set in \texttt{\justify LocalSettings.php}, the global variable \texttt{\justify \$wgArticlePlaceholderImageProperty} is wrapped in an array and returned in the function \texttt{\justify getImageProperty()}. Lua functions can have multiple return values \citep{luabook:01}, thus Scribunto needs an array to model that. \\
In Lua, these PHP callbacks are copied from \texttt{\justify mw\char`_interface} to the local variable \texttt{php}. From this variable the PHP functions in \texttt{\justify Scribunto\char`_LuaArticle PlaceholderLibrary} can be invoked. Therefore the image property ID can now be used in Lua as well, by invoking \texttt{\justify getImageProperty()} in \texttt{\justify mw.ext.articleplaceholder.entityRenderer}. \\
Getting the array with the ordered properties requires a service, the \texttt{ArticlePlaceholderService}.It returns an instance of itself. Its function \texttt{\justify getPropertyOrderProvider()} returns an instance of the \texttt{\justify PropertyOrderProvider} described in Chapter~\ref{ordering-stat}: \nameref{ordering-stat}. This follows the \textit{Singleton pattern}, which enforces, according to \citet{designpattern}, ``that only one instance of a class will be created''.
In \texttt{\justify Scribunto\char`_LuaArticle PlaceholderLibrary} in the function \texttt{\justify Scribunto\char`_LuaArticlePlace-holderLibrary} this service is called and the associative array of ordered properties is returned.\\
Like the image property, the function can be invoked in the Lua module.
