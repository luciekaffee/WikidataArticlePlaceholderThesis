\section{Unit tests}

MediaWiki, and therefore Wikibase too, use \textit{PHPUnit} for automated testing. PHPUnit is a test framework for PHP. \\
The tests for each class are named according to the class names with the suffix \textit{Test}. \\
\begin{quote}
 ``When we are writing a test in which we cannot (or choose not to) use a real depended-on component (DOC), we can replace it with a \textit{Test Double}. The \textit{Test Double} doesn't have to behave exactly like the real DOC; it merely has to provide the same API as the real one so that the SUT [system under test] \textit{thinks} it is the real one'' states \citet{testing}. 
\end{quote}
PHPUnit provides the option to create so called \textit{mocks} as test doubles. In the test class \texttt{SearchHookHandlerTest}, for example, the SpecialPage \texttt{SpecialSearch} is mocked to work on a test double. \\
PHPUnit allows using data providers. Those data providers return an array of arrays, which provide data for a test method. This way, one method can test several different cases with multiple datasets. The arrays can contain a message explaining what the test is about, a parameter passed to the tested method, and the expected value returned. \\
Each test method can contain one or more assertion. Those are able to test whether the result of the tested function equals the expected value.
