\section{Unit tests}

MediaWiki and therefore also Wikibase use \textit{PHPUnit} for automated testing. PHPUnit is a test framework for PHP. \\
The tests for each class are named according to the class names with the suffix \textit{Test}. \\
\begin{quote}
 When we are writing a test in which we cannot (or chose not to) use a real depended-on component (DOC), we can replace it with a Test Double. The Test Double doesn't have to behave exactly like the real DOC; it merely has to provide the same API as the real one so that the SUT thinks it is the real one! 
\end{quote}
states \citet{testing}. \\
PHPUnit provides the possibility to create so called \textit{mocks} as test doubles. In the test class \texttt{SearchHookHandler}, for example, the SpecialPage \texttt{SpecialSearch} is mocked to work on a test double. \\
PHPUnit uses data providers. Those data providers return an array of arrays, which provide data for a test method. This way, one method can test several different cases with divers data. The arrays contain a message what the test is about, a parameter passed to the tested method, and the expected value returned. \\
Each test method contains at least one assertion. Those test whether the result of the tested function equals the expected value.
