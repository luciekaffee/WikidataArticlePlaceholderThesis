\section{Setting up the extension}
	To enable and setup an extension in MediaWiki, the extension has to have a file called \texttt{\justify ExtensionName.php}, which in this case would be \texttt{\justify ArticlePlaceholder.php}. \texttt{\justify ArticlePlaceholder.php} stores the setup instructions and contains declarations and definitions important to this extension. \\
	To register the extension in MediaWiki, in the file \texttt{\justify LocalSettings.php} the ArticlePlaceholder is set with \texttt{\justify require\_once( ``\$IP/extensions/ArticlePlaceholder/ArticlePlaceholder.php'' );}. \\
	Additionally the extension registration has the global variable \texttt{\justify \$wgArticlePlaceholderImageProperty}. This is needed for the user installing the extension to set the image property of their repository. In the case of Wikidata this would be \textit{``image'' (P18)}. \citep{wiki:23}
