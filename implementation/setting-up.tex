\section{Setting up the extension}
	To enable and configure an extension in MediaWiki, the extension needs to contain a file called \texttt{\justify ExtensionName.php}, which in this case would be \texttt{\justify ArticlePlaceholder.php}. \texttt{\justify ArticlePlaceholder.php} contains declarations and definitions that are important for this extension. \\
	To register the extension in MediaWiki, in the file \texttt{\justify LocalSettings.php} the ArticlePlaceholder is included with \texttt{\justify require\_once ``\$IP/extensions/ArticlePlaceholder/ArticlePlaceholder.php'';}. \\
	Additionally the extension uses the global variable \texttt{\justify \$wgArticlePlaceholderImageProperty}. This is needed for the user installing the extension to specify the image property of their repository \citep{wiki:23}. In the case of Wikidata this would be \textit{``image'' (P18)}.
