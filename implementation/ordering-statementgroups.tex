\section{Ordering of statement groups}

To find a technical solution to this problem, there was a "Request for comment" page set up. \href{https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Requests_for_comment/Statement_group_ordering}{Requests for comment/Statement group ordering}

The most important points are outlined there: \\
All Property IDs are collected on one page, that is in the mediawiki namespace. 

\href{https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Namespaces#MediaWiki}{The MediaWiki namespace is used to hold system messages and other important content. For instance, the page MediaWiki:Edit (or MediaWiki:Vector-view-edit in the default "Vector" skin) contains the text that fills the "Edit" tab at the top of every page. If that page exists, it overrides the default content, which is "Edit". Similarly, MediaWiki:Common.css is the system message that holds the CSS code that is loaded for all users for each page. It has the special property that the entire namespace is fully protected and can only be edited by administrators.}
