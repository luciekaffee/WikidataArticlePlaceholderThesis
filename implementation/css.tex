\subsection{Style elements (CSS)}

In order to style the layout elements, CSS classes are assigned in the Lua module. Their looks as well as the create article button's look are adjusted in \texttt{ext.articleplaceholder.defaultDisplay.css}. \\
So as not to conflict with other MediaWiki style elements, the CSS classes are prefixed with \texttt{\justify articleplaceholder-}. \\
The \texttt{\justify divs} are nested so that, for example, the main image and the identifier (which both have their own \texttt{div}) are in one \texttt{div} named after its position in the layout \texttt{\justify articleplaceholder-sidebar}. Additionally the identifiers are all in one \texttt{div}, the \texttt{\justify articleplaceholder-identifierlist}. \\
The number of columns containing the statement groups differs depending on the number of statements. When the browser window is smaller, the number of boxes per row adjusts accordingly. Initially it was planned to adjust them to a tiling layout, but since tiling layout in pure CSS would expect the boxes to be ordered vertically in columns, this was not possible. It is crucial to show the most important information first, otherwise the ordering of statement groups would be pointless. \\
In order to be responsive, the extension makes use of \textit{media queries}. Media queries are a convenient way to add CSS styles for elements that need to be adjusted for different devices \citep[43]{mediaquery}.\\
In MediaWiki with the \textit{resource loader} \texttt{\justify \$wgResourceModules} media queries can be assigned to CSS modules. This allows loading another CSS module (\texttt{\justify ext.articleplaceholder.defaultDisplaySmall.css}), when the screen size is smaller then 930 pixels. This  prevents the overlapping of the sidebar with the image and identifiers and the statement groups.
