\section{Smart red links}\label{sec:redLinks}
	Red links on Wikipedia display a title of an article, that does not exist yet but is wished. It is difficult to connect a title to a Wikidata item since the item does not necessarily have the same label as the title of the page. Therefore linking red links to ArticlePlaceholder is rather demanding and not in the scope of this thesis. \\
	However, there is a discussion Discussion page smart red links on how this could be realized, which is summarized in this chapter. \citep{wiki:22} \\
	\\
	The goal would be to have \textit{smart red links}, which are connected to a Wikidata item. In order for this to work, the Wikidata sitelinks could be used. Basically there would be \textit{virtual sitelinks}, so editors could connect links to non-existing articles on Wikidata the same way links to existing articles would be added. This way, the text of the article and its Wikitext would not change. On Wikidata, those links could either be in an own section or be displayed in red. \\
	There are multiple ways for editors to add those sitelinks to Wikidata. Existing red links would have to be migrated by editors. Clicking a red link that is not yet connected could lead the editors to a page asking them for the same article in another language and then automatically add the red link to the corresponding Wikidata item. If none exists there is still the possibility to just add the Wikidata item ID. \\
	If an editor adds a red link, they could be asked to add it to the corresponding Wikidata item before saving their edit. \\
	In the case of an editor using ContentTranslation, the link would be added automatically since the article in another language is known. \\

	Since this would also give editors an overview over wanted pages in Wikidata, there are more benefits than only having ArticlePlaceholder connected to red links.
